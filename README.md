# Julia Sets
This activity is about exploring the beauty of mathematics through creating and displaying julia sets. 

## Dynamical Systems
A dynamical system is defined by a function that ddescribes the time dependance of a point in space. In this activity we will be talking about complex dynamical systems. That is, dynamical systems of a complex variable. The systems that we will consider then are of the form $F:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$

# Julia Sets
This activity is about exploring the beauty of mathematics through creating and displaying julia sets. 

## Dynamical Systems
A dynamical system is defined by a function that ddescribes the time dependance of a point in space. In this activity we will be talking about complex dynamical systems. That is, dynamical systems of a complex variable. The systems that we will consider then are of the form [].

### Orbits and Itineraries
Because Dynamical systems describe a time dependent system we can determine the iternerary of a certain point by considering the following sequence: 

where:
.
We call this sequence the itinerary of ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x)
To clarify notation we will also describe:
as the n<sup>th</sup> composure of F with itself.
